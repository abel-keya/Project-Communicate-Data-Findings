# Project-Communicate-Data-Findings

**Problem statement** Apply design and data visualization principles to the data analysis process by creating visualizations to tell a story with data.

# Dataset
 
 
# Main findings from the exploratory data analysis


# Choice the results to put in your explanatory analysis


# Feedback from others for your explanatory designs



# List of resources used during the creation of the project. 
* web sites, 
* books, 
* forums, 
* blog posts 
* GitHub repositories.
**Problem statement:**  

Build a model that predicts whether or not the patient's has hypothyroid  clinical  test data collected at Nairobi Hospital 



  
  
# Description

### Solution 1: Decision trees classification Models:

- Boosted Decision Tree models that makes the above prediction. 
* Random forests,
* Ada boosted trees,
* gradient boosting.
</p>
- optimization of each of the the above models to Identify the best model, and used the best model to determine which features are most impactful in influencing the prediction

### Solution 2: Support Vector Machine:

- The project code applies rbf,Sigmoid and Polynomial kernel function to build the SVM model and then evaluates their performance and then  pick the kernel that performs the best. 
- the best kernel is  used with tuned parameters and  additional features. 
visualization of  the models created.

# Context

<p>
   
### Hypothyroidism: (Underactive Thyroid)-Too Little Thyroid Hormone
Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland is not able to produce enough thyroid hormone. Since the main purpose of thyroid hormone is to "run the body's metabolism," it is understandable that people with this condition will have symptoms associated with a slow metabolism.
