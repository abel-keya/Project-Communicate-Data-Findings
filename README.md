**Problem statement** Apply design and data visualization principles to the data analysis process by creating visualizations to tell a story with data.

#
[dataset](https://github.com/abel-keya/week8_IP_Abel_Keya_Nairobi-Hospital-conducted-a-clinical-camp-to-test-for-hypothyroidism/blob/master/hypothyroid.csv):
In this project i used the **house_prices** provided in the workspace .The dataset has the following features:
The dataset contains 6028 records, and 7 columns.
 
* price - Price of the house
* bedrooms - Number of Bedrooms
* bathrooms - Number of Bathrooms
* style-the archtectural style of the house
* Neighborhood-the surroundig area where the house located.

# Main findings from the exploratory data analysis
* There is a strong positive correlation between price,style and area in all the three neighbohood 
* High correlation between area,bathrooms,bedrooms, and price
* The house prices increases with the increase int the number of bedrooms, with the 8 bedrooms having the highest price figure while 1 bedroom has the lowest.This is surprising because the houses with 0 bedroom have higher prices compared to the 1 bedroom house
* There are 3 main house styles which have variation in prices in relation to the Neighborhood and house bedrooms/bathroomsVictorian Style is the most popular with the highest percentage approximately 50%, Ranch is the second most popular house styles with approximately 29.9%, Lodge style is least popular accounting to approximately 20.4 %

* Neighborhood B is the most popular with the highest percentage representation at approximately 40.26%,Neighborhood A follows with * * * approximately 31 % while Neighborhood C is the least popular with approximately 28.6%

# Choice of the results to put in your explanatory analysis


I chose  results on :
* price distribution
* price variation with respect Number of bedrooms,bathrooms,Neighborhood and styles
This is because the above factors are intertwined and each has an effect to the choice of a house and demand.
